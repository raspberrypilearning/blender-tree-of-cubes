## Render

To see how your tree looks, you need to see it from the perspective of the camera by rendering the image:

--- task ---

Press <kbd>F12</kbd>.

It could be that you don't see the tree properly, or perhaps it doesn't look very tree-like from the camera view. For example:

![Tree render](images/blender-tree-render-1.png)

--- /task ---
 

--- task ---

Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit the view.

--- /task ---
 

--- task ---
Adjust your tree. 

+ If the tree didn't look very tree-like, you might want to rearrange the cubes a bit.
+ If your tree didn't fit into the camera's view, move the camera so that the tree shows up properly through the camera.
+ You can also play around with the lamp to improve the lighting of your tree.

Hit <kbd>F12</kbd> again to see the rendered image.
