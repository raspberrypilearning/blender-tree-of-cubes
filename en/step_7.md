## Render

To see how your tree looks like we need to see it from the camera by rendering the image:

+ Press <kbd>F12</kbd> or, if you're working on a Mac, <kbd>FN + F12</kbd>.

It could be that you don't see the tree properly. Or it doesn't look very tree like from the camera. For example:

![Tree render](images/blender-tree-render-1.png)

+ Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit the view.

+ If it didn't look very tree like, you might want to rearrange the cubes a bit.

+ If your tree didn't fit into the camera, move it such that it shows up properly through the camera.

+ Hit <kbd>F12</kbd> again or, if you're working on a Mac, <kbd>FN + F12</kbd> to see the rendered image.

You can also play around with the lamp to improve the lightning of your tree.
